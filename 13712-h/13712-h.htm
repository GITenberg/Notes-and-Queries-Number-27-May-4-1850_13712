<h3>THE MOSQUITO COUNTRY.&mdash;ORIGIN OF THE NAME.&mdash;EARLY
CONNECTION OF THE MOSQUITO INDIANS WITH THE ENGLISH.</h3>
<p>The subject of the Mosquito country has lately acquired a
general interest. I am anxious to insert the following "Notes and
Queries" in your useful periodical, hoping thus to elicit
additional information, or to assist other inquirers.</p>
<p>1. As to the origin of the name. I believe it to be probably
derived from an native name of a tribe of Indians in that part of
America. The Spanish Central Americans speak of <i>Moscos</i>.
Juarros, A Spanish Central American author, in his <i>History of
Guatemala</i>, names the Moscos among other Indians inhabiting the
north-eastern corner of that tract of country now called
<i>Mosquito</i>: and in the "Mosquito Correspondence" laid before
Parliament in 1848, the inhabitants of Mosquito are called
<i>Moscos</i> in the Spanish state-papers.</p>
<p>How and when would <i>Mosco</i> have become <i>Mosquito</i>? Was
it a Spanish elongation of the name, or an English corruption? In
the former case, it would probably have been another name of the
people: in the latter, probably a name given to the part of the
coast near which the Moscos lived.</p>
<p>The form <i>Mosquito</i>, or <i>Moskito</i>, or <i>Muskito</i>,
(as the word is variously spelt in our old books), is doubtless as
old as the earliest English intercourse with the Indians of the
Mosquito coast; and that may be as far back as about 1630: it is
certainly as far back as 1650.</p>
<p>If the name came from the synonymous insect, would it have been
given by the Spaniards or the English? <i>Mosquito</i> is the
Spanish diminutive name of a fly: but what we call a mosquito, the
Spaniards in Central America call by another name, <i>sanchujo</i>.
The Spaniards had very little connexion at any time with the
Mosquito Indians; and as mosquitoes are not more abundant on their
parts of the coast than on other parts, or in the interior, where
the Spaniards settled, there would have been no reason for their
giving the name on account of insects. Nor, indeed, would the
English, who went to the coast from Jamaica, or other West India
Islands, where mosquitoes are quite as abundant, have had any such
reason either. At Bluefields where the writer has resided, which
was one of the first places on the Mosquito coast frequented by
English, and which derives its name from an old English buccaneer,
there are no mosquitoes at all. At Grey Town, at the mouth of the
river San Juan, there are plenty; but not more than in Jamaica, or
in the towns of the interior state of Nicaragua. However names are
not always given so as to be argument-proof.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id=
"page426"></a>{426}</span>
<p>How did the word <i>mosquito</i> come into our language? From
the Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian? How old is it with us? Todd
adds the word <i>Muskitto</i>, or <i>Musquitto</i>, to Johnson's
<i>Dictionary</i>; and gives an example from Purchas's
<i>Pilgrimage</i> (1617), where the word is spelt more like the
Italian form:&mdash;"They paint themselves to keep off the
muskitas."</p>
<p>There is a passage in Southey's <i>Omniana</i> (vol. i. p. 21.)
giving an account of a curious custom among the Mozcas, a tribe of
New Granada: his authority is <i>Hist. del Nuevo Reyno de
Granada</i>, l. i. c. 4. These are some way south of the other
Moscos, but it is probably the same word.</p>
<p>One of the Virgin Islands in the West Indies has the name of
Mosquito.</p>
<p>Some "Mosquito Kays" are laid down on the chart off Cape Gracias
&agrave; Dios, on the Mosquito coast; but these probably would have
been named from the Mosquito Indians of the continent. And these
Mosquito Indians appear to have spread themselves from Cape Gracias
&agrave; Dios.</p>
<p>It is stated, however, in Strangeways' <i>Account of the
Mosquito Shore</i>, (not a work of authority), that these Mosquito
Kays give the name to the country:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This country, as is generally supposed, derives its name from a
clustre of small islands or banks situated near its coasts, and
called the <i>Mosquitos</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should be glad if these Notes and Queries would bring
assistance to settle the origin of the name of the Mosquito country
from some of your correspondents who are learned in the history of
Spanish conquest and English enterprise in that part of America, or
who may have attended to the languages of the American Indians.</p>
<p>2. I propose to jot down a few Notes as to the early connexion
between the English and the Mosquito Indians, and shall be thankful
for references to additional sources of information.</p>
<p>I have read somewhere, that a Mosquito king, or prince, was
brought to England in Charles I.'s reign by Richard Earl of
Warwick, who had commanded a ship in the West Indies; but I forget
where I read it. I remember, however, that no authority was given
for the statement. Can any of your readers give me information
about this?</p>
<p>Dampier mentions a party of English who, about the year 1654,
ascended the Cape River (the mouth of which is at Cape Gracias
&agrave; Dios) to Segovia, a Spanish town in the interior; and
another party of English and French who, after the year 1684, when
he was in these parts, crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic,
descending the Cape River. (Harris's <i>Collection of Voyages</i>,
vol. i. p. 92.) Are there any accounts of these expeditions?</p>
<p>Dampier also speaks of a confederacy having been formed between
a party of English under a Captain Wright and the San Blas Indians
of Darien, which was brought about by Captain Wright's taking two
San Blas boys to be educated "in the country of the Moskitoes," and
afterwards faithfully restoring them, and which opened to the
English the way by land to the Pacific Sea. (Harris, vol. i. p.
97.) Are there any accounts of English travellers by this way,
which would be in the very part of the isthmus of which Humboldt
has lately recommended a careful survey? (See <i>Aspects of
Nature</i>, Sabine's translation.)</p>
<p>Esquemeling, in his <i>History of the Buccaneers</i>, of whom he
was one, says that in 1671 many of the Indians at Cape Gracias
spoke English and French from their intercourse with the pirates.
He gives a curious and not very intelligible account of Cape
Gracias, as an island of about thirty leagues round (formed, I
suppose, by rivers and the sea), containing about 1600 or 1700
persons, who have no king; (this is quite at variance with all
other accounts of the Mosquito Indians of Cape Gracias); and
having, he proceeds to say, no correspondence with the neighbouring
islands. (I cannot explain this; there is certainly no island
ninety miles in circumference at sea near Cape Gracias.)</p>
<p>A quarto volume published by Cadell in 1789, entitled <i>The
Case of His Majesty's Subjects having Property in and lately
established upon the Mosquito Shore</i>, gives the fullest account
of the early connexion between the Mosquito Indians and the
English. The writer says that Jeremy, king of the Mosquitos, in
Charles II.'s reign, after formally ceding his country to officers
sent to him by the Governor of Jamaica to receive the cession, went
to Jamaica, and thence to England, where he was generously received
by Charles II., "who had him often with him in his private parties
of pleasure, admired his activity, strength, and manly
accomplishments; and not only defrayed every expense, but loaded
him with presents." Is there any notice of this visit in any of our
numerous memoirs and diaries of Charles II.'s reign?</p>
<p>A curious tract, printed in the sixth volume of Churchill's
<i>Voyages</i>, "The Mosquito Indian and his Golden River, being a
familiar Description of the Mosquito Kingdom, &amp;c., written in
or about the Year 1699 by M.W.," from which Southey drew some
touches of Indian manners for his "Madoc," speaks of another King
Jeremy, son of the previous one; who, it is said, esteemed himself
a subject of the King of England, and had visited the Duke of
Albemarle in Jamaica. His father had been carried to England, and
received from the King of England a crown and commission. The
writer of this account says that the Mosquito Indians generally
esteem themselves English:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And, indeed, they are extremely courteous to all Englishmen,
esteeming themselves to be such, although some Jamaica men have
very much abused them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will conclude this communication, whose length will I hope be
excused for the newness of the subject, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>{427}</span> by an
amusing passage of a speech of Governor Johnstone in a debate in
the House of Commons on the Mosquito country in 1777:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I see the noble lord [Lord North] now collects his knowledge by
piecemeal from those about him. While my hon. friend [some one was
whispering Lord North] now whispers the noble lord, will he also
tell him, and the more aged gentlemen of the House, before we yield
up our right to the Mosquito shore, that it is from thence we
receive the greatest part of our delicious turtle? May I tell the
younger part, before they give their consent, that it is from
thence comes the sarsaparilla to purify our blood?"&mdash;<i>Parl.
Hist.</i> vol. xix. p. 54.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BACON AND JEREMY TAYLOR.</h3>
<p>In his essay "On Delays," Bacon quotes a "common verse" to this
effect:&mdash;"Occasion turneth a bald noddle after she hath
presented her locks in front, and no hold taken." As no reference
is given, some readers may be glad to see the original, which
occurs in an epigram on [Greek: Kairos] (Brunck's <i>Analecta</i>,
ii. 49.; Posidippi Epigr. 13. in Jacob's <i>Anthol.</i> ii.
49.).</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>[Greek:</p>
<p>Hae de komae, ti kat' opsin; hupantiasanti labesthai,</p>
<p class="i2">nae Dia. Taxopithen d' eis ti phalakra pelei;</p>
<p>Ton gar apax ptaenoisi parathrexanta me possin</p>
<p class="i2">outis eth' himeiron draxetai exopithen.]</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Jermey Taylor's <i>Life of Christ</i> (Pref. &sect; 29. p.
23. Eden's edition), it is said that Mela and Solinus report of the
Thracians that they believed in the resurrection of the dead. That
passage of Mela referred to is, l. ii. c. ii. &sect; 3., where see
Tzschucke.</p>
<p>In the same work (Pref. &sect; 20. p. 17.), "&AElig;lian tells
us of a nation who had a law binding them to beat their parents to
death with clubs when they lived to a decrepit age." See
&AElig;lian, <i>Var. Hist.</i> iv. 1. p. 330. Gronov., who,
however, says nothing of clubs.</p>
<p>In the next sentence, the statement, "the Persian <i>magi</i>
mingled with their mothers and all their nearest relatives," is
from Xanthus (Fragm. 28., Didot), apud Clem. Alexandr. (Strom. iii.
p. 431 A.). See Jacob's <i>Lect. Stob.</i> p. 144.; Bahr, <i>On
Herodotus</i>, iii. 31.</p>
<p>In the same work (Part I. sect. viii. &sect; 5. note <i>n</i>,
p. 174.) is a quotation from Seneca, "O quam contempta res est
homo, nisi super humana se erexerit!" which is plainly the original
of the lines of Daniel, so often quoted by Coleridge ("Epistle to
the Countess of Cumberland"):&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Unless above himself he can</p>
<p>Erect himself, now mean a thing is man!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps some of your readers can supply the reference to the
passage in Seneca; which is wanting in Mr. Eden's edition.</p>
<p>In Part III. sect. xv. &sect; 19. p. 694. note <i>a</i>, of the
<i>Life of Christ</i>, is a quotation from Strabo, lib. xv.
<i>Add.</i> p. 713., Casaub.</p>
<p>As the two great writers on whom I have made these notes are now
in course of publication, any notes which your correspondents can
furnish upon them cannot fail to be welcome. Milton also, and Pope,
are in the hands of competent editors, who, doubtless, would be
glad to have their work rendered more complete through the medium
of "NOTES AND QUERIES."</p>

<h3>DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>
<p>Thomas Vernon, author of <i>Vernon's Reports</i>, was in early
life private secretary to the Duke of Monouth, and is supposed to
have had a pretty large collection of Monmouth's correspondence.
Vernon settled himself at Hanbury Hall, in Worcestershire, where he
built a fine house, and left a large estate. In course of time this
passed to an heiress, who married Mr. Cecil (the Earl of Exeter of
Alfred Tennyson), and was divorced from him. Lord Exeter sold or
carried away the fine library, family plate, and nearly everything
curious or valuable that was not an heirloom in the Vernon family.
He laid waste the extensive gardens, and sold the elaborate iron
gates, which now adorn the avenue to Mere Hall in the immediate
neighbourhood. The divorc&eacute;e married a Mr. Phillips, and
dying without surviving issue, the estates passed to a distant
branch of her family. About ten years ago I made a careful search
(by permission) at Hanbury Hall for the supposed Monmouth MSS., but
found none; and I ascertained by inquiry that there were none at
Enstone Hall, the seat of Mr. Phillips's second wife and widow. The
MSS. might have been carried to Burleigh, and a friend obtained for
me a promise from the Marquis of Exeter that search should be made
for them there, but I have reason to believe that the matter was
forgotten. Perhaps some of your correspondents may have the means
of ascertaining whether there are such MSS. in Lord Exeter's
library. I confess my doubt whether so cautious a man as Thomas
Vernon would have retained in his possession a mass of
correspondence that might have been fraught with danger to himself
personally; and, had it been in the Burleigh library, whether it
could have escaped notice. This, however, is to be noted. After
Vernon's death there was a dispute whether his MSS. were to pass to
his heir-at-law or to his personal representatives, and the court
ordered the MSS. (Reports) to be printed. This was done very
incorrectly, and Lord Kenyon seems to have hinted that private
reasons have been assigned for that, but these could hardly have
related to the Monmouth MSS.</p>

<h3>PARNELL.</h3>
<p>The following verses by Parnell are not included in any edition
of his poems that I have seen. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page428" id="page428"></a>{428}</span> They are printed in
Steele's <i>Miscellany</i> (12mo. 1714), p. 63., and in the second
edition of the same <i>Miscellany</i> (12mo. 1727), p. 51., with
Parnell's name, and, what is more, on both occasions among other
poems by the same author.</p>

<h3>EARLY ENGLISH AND EARLY GERMAN LITERATURE.&mdash;"NEWS" AND
"NOISE."</h3>
<p>I am anxious to put a question as to the communication that may
have taken place between the English and German tongues previous to
the sixteenth century. Possibly the materials for answering it may
not exist; but it appears to me that it is of great importance, in
an etymological point of view, that the extent of such
communication, and the influence it has had upon our language,
should be ascertained. In turning over the leaves of the
<i>Shakspeare Society's Papers</i>, vol. i., some time ago, my
attention was attracted by a "Song in praise of his Mistress," by
John Heywood, the dramatist. I was immediately struck by the great
resemblance it presented to another poem on the same subject by a
German writer, whose real or assumed name, I do not know which, was
"Muscanbl&uuml;t," and which poem is to be found in <i>Der Clara
H&auml;tzlerin Liederbuch</i>, a collection made by a nun of
Augsburg in 1471. The following are passages for
comparison:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p><i>Clara H&auml;tzlerin Liederbuch</i>, p. 111.</p>
<p>In all this there is certainly nothing to warrant the conclusion
that the German poem was the original of Heywood's song; but,
considering that the latter was produced so near to the same age as
the former, that is, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and
considering that the older German poetical literature had already
passed its culminating point, while ours was upon the ascending
scale, there is likeness enough, both in manner and measure, to
excite the suspicion of direct or indirect communication.</p>
<p>The etymology of the word "news," on which you have recently had
some notes, is a case in illustration of the importance of this
point. I have never had the least doubt that this word is derived
immediately from the German. It is, in fact, "das Neue" in the
genitive case; the German phrase "Was giebt's Neues?" giving the
exact sense of our "What is the news?" This will appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id=
"page429"></a>{429}</span> even stronger if we go back to the date
of the first use of the word in England. Possibly about the same
time, or not much earlier, we find in his same collection of Clara
H&auml;tzlerin, the word spelt "new" and rhyming to "triu."</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Empfach mich uff das New</p>
<p>In deines hertzen triu."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The genitive of this would be "newes," thus spelt and probably
pronounced the same as in England. That the word is not derived
from the English adjective "new"&mdash;that it is not of English
manufacture at all&mdash;I feel well assured: in that case the
"<i>s</i>" would be the sign of the plural: and we should have, as
the Germans have, either extant or obsolete, also "the new." The
English language, however, has never dealt in these abstractions,
except in its higher poetry; though some recent translators from
the German have disregarded the difference in this respect between
the powers of the two languages. "News" is a noun singular, and as
such must have been adopted bodily into the language; the form of
the genitive case, commonly used in conversation, not being
understood, but being taken for an integral part of the word, as
formerly the Koran was called "<i>The Alcoran</i>."</p>
<p>"Noise," again, is evidently of the same derivation, though from
a dialect from which the modern German pronunciation of the
diphthong is derived. Richardson, in his <i>English Dictionary</i>,
assumes it to be of the same derivation as "noxious" and "noisome;"
but there is no process known to the English language by which it
could be manufactured without making a plural noun of it. In short,
the two words are identical; "news" retaining its primitive, and
"noise" adopting a consequential meaning.</p>

<p><i>Charms.</i>&mdash;<i>The Evil Eye.</i>&mdash;Going one day
into a cottage in the village of Catterick, in Yorkshire, I
observed hung up behind the door a ponderous necklace of "lucky
stones," <i>i.e.</i> stones with a hole through them. On hinting an
inquiry as to their use, I found the good lady of the house
disposed to shuffle off any explanation; but by a little
importunity I discovered that they had the credit of being able to
preserve the house and its inhabitants from the baneful influence
of the "evil eye." "Why, Nanny," said I, "you surely don't believe
in witches now-a-days?" "No! I don't say 'at I do; but certainly i'
former times there <i>was</i> wizzards an' buzzards, and them sort
o' things." "Well," said I, laughing, "but you surely don't think
there are any now?" "No! I don't say at ther' are; but I <i>do</i>
believe in a <i>yevil</i> eye." After a little time I extracted
from poor Nanny more particulars on the subject, as viz.:&mdash;how
that there was a woman in the village whom she strongly suspected
of being able to look with an evil eye; how, further, a neighbour's
daughter, against whom the old lady in question had a grudge owing
to some love affair, had suddenly fallen into a sort of pining
sickness, of which the doctors could make nothing at all; and how
the poor thing fell away without any accountable cause, and finally
died, nobody knew why; but how it was her (Nanny's) strong belief
that she had pined away in consequence of a glance from the evil
eye. Finally, I got from her an account of how any one who chose
could themselves obtain the power of the evil eye, and the receipt
was, as nearly as I can recollect, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ye gang out ov' a night&mdash;ivery night, while ye find nine
toads&mdash;an' when ye've gitten t' nine toads, ye hang 'em up ov'
a string, an' ye make a hole and buries t' toads i't hole&mdash;and
as 't toads pines away, so 't person pines away 'at you've looked
upon wiv a yevil eye, an' they pine and pine away while they die,
without ony disease at all!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know if this is the orthodox creed respecting the mode
of gaining the power of the evil eye, but it is at all events a
genuine piece of Folk Lore.</p>
<p>The above will corroborate an old story rife in Yorkshire, of an
ignorant person, who, being asked if he ever said his prayers,
repeated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"From witches and wizards and long-tail'd buzzards,</p>

<p>Ecclesfield, April 24. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Charms.</i>&mdash;I beg to represent to the correspondents of
the "NOTES AND QUERIES," especially to the clergy and medical men
resident in the country, that notices of the superstitious
practices still prevalent, or recently prevalent, in different
parts of the kingdom, for the cure of diseases, are highly
instructive and even valuable, on many accounts. Independently of
their arch&aelig;ological <span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"
id="page430"></a>{430}</span> interest as illustrations of the mode
of thinking and acting of past times, they become really valuable
to the philosophical physician, as throwing light on the natural
history of diseases. The prescribers and practisers of such
"charms," as well as the lookers-on, have all unquestionable
evidence of the <i>efficacy</i> of the prescriptions, in a great
many cases: that is to say, the diseases for which the charms are
prescribed <i>are cured</i>; and, according to the mode of
reasoning prevalent with prescribers, orthodox and heterodox, they
must be cured by them,&mdash;<i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i>.
Unhappily for the scientific study of diseases, the universal
interference of ART <i>in an active form</i> renders it difficult
to meet with <i>pure specimens</i> of corporeal maladies; and,
consequently, it is often difficult to say whether it is nature or
art that must be credited for the event. This is a positive
misfortune, in a scientific point of view. Now, as there can be no
question as to the non-efficiency of <i>charms</i> in a material or
physical point of view (their action through the imagination is a
distinct and important subject of inquiry), it follows that every
disease getting well in the practice of the charmer, is curable and
cured by Nature. A faithful list of such cases could not fail to be
most useful to the scientific inquirer, and to the progress of
truth; and it is therefore that I am desirous of calling the
attention of your correspondents to the subject. As a general rule,
it will be found that the diseases in which charms have obtained
most fame as curative are those of long duration, not dangerous,
yet not at all, or very slightly, benefited by ordinary medicines.
In such cases, of course, there is not room for the display of an
imaginary agency:&mdash;"For," as Crabbe says,&mdash;and I hope
your medical readers will pardon the irreverence&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"For NATURE then has time to work <i>her</i> way;</p>

</div>
<p>The notice in your last Number respecting the cure of
hooping-cough, is a capital example of what has just been stated;
and I doubt not but many of your correspondents could supply
numerous prescriptions equally scientific and equally effective. On
a future occasion, I will myself furnish you with some; but as I
have already trespassed so far on your space, I will conclude by
naming a few diseases in which the charmers may be expected to
charm most wisely and well. They will all be found to come within
the category of the diseases characterised above:&mdash;Epilepsy,
St. Vitus's Dance (<i>Chorea</i>), Hysteria, Toothache, Warts,
Ague, Mild Skin-diseases, Tic Douloureux, Jaundice, Asthma,
Bleeding from the Nose, St. Anthony's Fire or The Rose
(<i>Erysipelas</i>), King's Evil (<i>Scrofula</i>), Mumps,

<h3>THE ANGLO-SAXON WORD "UNLAED."</h3>
<p>A long etymological disquisition may seem a trifling matter; but
what a clear insight into historic truth, into the manners, the
customs, and the possessions of people of former ages, is sometimes
obtained by the accurate definition of even a single word. A
pertinent instance will be found in the true etymon of
<i>Brytenwealda</i>, given by Mr. Kemble in his chapter "On the
Growth of the kingly Power." (<i>Saxons in Engl.</i> B. II. c. 1.)
Upon this consideration I must rest for this somewhat lengthy
investigation.</p>
<p>The word UNLAED, as far as we at present know, occurs only five
times in Anglo-Saxon; three of which are in the legend of Andreas
in the Vercelli MS., which legend was first printed, under the
auspices of the Record Commission, by Mr. Thorpe; but the Report to
which the poetry of the Vercelli MS. was attached has, for reasons
with which I am unacquainted, never been made public. In 1840,
James Grimm, "feeling (as Mr. Kemble says) that this was a wrong
done to the world of letters at large," published it at Cassell,
together with the Legend of Elene, or the Finding of the Cross,
with an Introduction and very copious notes. In 1844, it was
printed for the Aelfric Society by Mr. Kemble, accompanied by a
translation, in which the passages are thus given.&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Such was the people's</p>
<p>peaceless token,</p>
<p>the suffering of the <i>wretched</i>."</p>
<p class="i4">l. 57-9.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When they of <i>savage spirits</i></p>
<p>believed in the might,"</p>
<p class="i4">l. 283-4.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ye are <i>rude</i>,</p>
<p>of poor thoughts."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The fifth instance of the occurrence of the word is in a passage
cited by Wanley, Catal. p. 134., <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page431" id="page431"></a>{431}</span> from a homily occurring in
a MS. in Corpus Christi College, s. 14.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Men &eth;a leo&ccedil;es can hep re3&thorn; se hal3a se[~s]
Io[~hs] &thorn;aep re Hael. eode ofen &thorn;one bupnan the Ledpoc
hatte, on in[=e]n aenne p[.y]ptun. Tha piste se unlaesde iudas se
&thorn;e hune to dea&thorn;e beleaped haefde."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Grimm's <i>Elucidations to Andreas</i> he thus notices
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unlaed, miser, improbus, infelix. (A. 142. 744. <i>Judith</i>,
134, 43.). A rare adjective never occurring in Beowulf, Coedmon, or
the Cod. Exon., and belonging to those which only appear in
conjunction with <i>un</i>. Thus, also, the Goth. unleds, pauper,
miser; and the O.H.G. unl&acirc;t (Graff, 2. 166.); we nowhere find
a l&ecirc;ds, laed, l&acirc;t, as an antithesis. It must have
signified <i>dives, felix</i>; and its root is wholly obscure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all the Anglo-Saxon examples of unlaed, the sense appears to
be <i>wretched</i>, <i>miserable</i>; in the Gothic it is uniformly
<i>poor</i><a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>: but <i>poverty</i> and
<i>wretchedness</i> are nearly allied. L&ecirc;d, or laed, would
evidently therefore signify <i>rich</i>, and by inference
<i>happy</i>. Now we have abundant examples of the use of the word
ledes in old English; not only for <i>people</i>, but for
<i>riches</i>, <i>goods</i>, <i>movable property</i>. Lond and
lede, or ledes, or lith, frequently occur unequivocally in this
latter sense, thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He was the first of Inglond that gaf God his tithe</p>
<p>Of isshue of bestes, of londes, or of <i>lithe</i>."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>P. Plouhm</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I bed hem bothe lond and <i>lede</i>,</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>K. of Tars</i>, 124.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For to have lond or <i>lede</i>,</p>
<p>Or <i>other riches</i>, so God me spede!</p>
<p>Yt ys to muche for me."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Sir Cleges</i>, 409.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Who schall us now geve londes or <i>lythe</i>,</p>
<p>Hawkys, or houndes, or stedys stithe,</p>
<p>As he was wont to do."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Le B. Florence of Rome</i>, 841.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"No asked he lond or <i>lithe</i>,</p>
<p>Bot that maiden bright."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Sir Tristrem</i>, xlviii.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In "William and the Werwolf" the cowherd and his wife resolve to
leave William</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Al here godis</p>
<p>Londes and <i>ludes</i> as ether after her lif dawes."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>p. 4</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this poem, <i>ludes</i> and <i>ledes</i> are used
indiscriminately, but most frequently in the sense of men, people.
Sir Frederick Madden has shown, from the equivalent words in the
French original of Robert of Brunne, "that he always uses the word
in the meaning of <i>possessions</i>, whether consisting of
tenements, rents, fees, &amp;c.;" in short, <i>wealth</i>.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the word has this sense in old English, we might
expect to find it in Anglo-Saxon, and I think it is quite clear
that we have it at least in one instance. In the <i>Ancient Laws
and Institutes of England</i>, vol. i. p. 184., an oath is given,
in which the following passage occurs:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Do spa to lane</p>
<p>beo &thorn;&eacute; he &thorn;inum</p>
<p>I leat me be minum</p>
<p>ne 3ypne le &thorn;ines</p>
<p>ne laedes ne landes</p>
<p>ne sac ne socne</p>
<p>ne &thorn;u mines ne &thorn;eapst</p>
<p>ne mint ic &thorn;e nan &thorn;io3."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. Thorpe has not translated the word, nor is it noticed in his
Glossary; but I think there can be no doubt that it should be
rendered by <i>goods</i>, <i>chattels</i>, or <i>wealth</i>, i.e.,
movable property.</p>
<p>This will be even more obvious from an extract given by Bishop
Nicholson, in the preface to Wilkin's <i>Leges Saxonic&aelig;</i>
p. vii. It is part of the oath of a Scotish baron of much later
date, and the sense here is unequivocal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I becom zour man my liege king in land, <i>lith</i><a id=
"footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href=
"#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>, life and lim, warldly honour,
homage, fealty, and leawty, against all that live and die."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous examples are to be found in the M.H. German, of which I
will cite a few:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ir habt doch zu iuwere hant</p>
<p>Beidin <i>liute</i> unde lant."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ich teile ir <i>liute</i> unde lant."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Id.</i> 7714.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And in the old translation of the <i>Liber Dialogorum</i> of St.
Gregory, printed in the cloister of S. Ulrich at Augspurg in
1473:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In der Statt waren hoch T&uuml;ren und sch&ouml;ne He&uuml;ser
von Silber und Gold, und aller Hand <i>le&uuml;t</i>, und die
Frawen und Man na&yuml;gten im alle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Jo. Morsheim in his <i>Untreuer Frawen</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Das was mein Herr gar gerne h&ouml;rt,</p>
<p>Und ob es <i>Leut</i> und Land bethort."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, when we recollect the state of the people in those times,
the serf-like vassalage, the <i>H&ouml;rigkeit</i> or
<i>Leibeigenthum</i>, which prevailed, we cannot be surprised that
a word which signified <i>possessions</i> should designate also the
<i>people</i>. It must still, however, be quite uncertain which is
the secondary sense.</p>
<p>The root of the word, as Grimm justly remarks, is very obscure;
and yet it seems to me that he himself has indirectly pointed it
out:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Goth. liudan<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
(crescere); O.H.G. liotan (sometimes unorganic, hliotan); O.H.G.

sumer -late (M.S. i. 124'b. 2. 161'a. virga herba). It is doubtful
whether ludja (facies), O.H.G. andlutti, is to be reckoned among
them."&mdash;<i>Deutsche Gram.</i> ii. 21. For this last see
Diefenbach, <i>Vergl. Gram. der Goth. Spr.</i> i. 242.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his <i>Erlauterungen zu Elene</i>, p. 166., Grimm further
remarks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The verb is leo&eth;an, lea&eth;, lu&eth;on (crescere), O.S.
lio&eth;an, l&ocirc;&eth;, lu&eth;un. Lelu&eth;on

Elene, 1227. 3elo&eth;en un&eth;ep le&aacute;pum (cretus sub

</blockquote>
<p>It has been surmised that LEDE was connected with the O.N.
hl&yuml;t<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>&mdash;which not only signified
<i>sors, portio</i>, but <i>res consistentia</i>&mdash;and the
A.-S. hlet, hlyt, lot, portion, inheritance: thus, in the A.-S.
Psal. xxx. 18., on han&eth;um &eth;inum hl&yuml;t m&iacute;n, <i>my
heritage is in thy hands</i>. Notker's version is: M&iacute;n
l&ocirc;z ist in d&iacute;nen handen. I have since found that
Kindlinger (<i>Geschichte der Deutchen H&ouml;rigkeit</i>) has made
an attempt to derive it from <i>Lied, Lit</i>, which in Dutch,
Flemish, and Low German, still signify a <i>limb</i>; I think,
unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Ray, in his <i>Gloss. Northanymbr.</i>, has "unlead, nomen
opprobrii;" but he gives a false derivation: Grose, in his
<i>Provincial Glossary</i>, "unleed or unlead, a general name for
any crawling venomous creature, as a toad, &amp;c. It is sometimes
ascribed to a man, and then it denotes a sly wicked fellow, that in
a manner creeps to do mischief. See Mr. Nicholson's Catalogue."</p>
<p>In the 2d edition of Mr. Brockett's <i>Glossary</i>, we have:
"Unletes, displacers or destroyers of the farmer's produce."</p>
<p>This provincial preservation of a word of such rare occurrence
in Anglo-Saxon, and of which no example has yet been found in old
English, is a remarkable circumstance. The word has evidently
signified, like the Gothic, in the first place <i>poor</i>; then
<i>wretched</i>, <i>miserable</i>; and hence, perhaps, its
opprobrious sense of <i>mischievous</i> or <i>wicked</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In those rude times when wealth or movable property consisted
almost entirely of living money, in which debts were contracted and
paid, and for which land was given in mortgage or sold; it is quite
certain that the serfs were transferred with the land, the lord
considering them as so much live-stock, or part of his
<i>chattels</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A vestige of this feeling with regard to dependants remains in
the use of the word <i>Man</i> (which formerly had the same sense
as <i>lede</i>). We still speak of "a general and his men," and use
the expression "our men." But, happily for the masses of mankind,
few vestiges of serfdom and slavery, and those in a mitigated form,
now virtually exist.</p>

<p>It occurs many times in the Moeso-Gothic version of the Gospels

iungalauths is used three times for [Greek: neaniskos], a young

<h3>ARABIC NUMERALS AND CIPHER.</h3>
<p>Will you suffer me to add some further remarks on the subject of
the Arabic numerals and cipher; as neither the querists nor
respondents seem to have duly appreciated the immense importance of
the step taken by introducing the use of a cipher. I would commence
with observing, that we know of no people tolerably advanced in
civilisation, whose system of notation had made such little
progress, beyond that of the mere savage, as the Romans. The rudest
savages could make upright scratches on the face of a rock, and set
them in a row, to signify units; and as the circumstance of having
ten fingers has led the people of every nation to give a distinct
name to the number ten and its multiples, the savage would have
taken but a little step when he invented such a mode of expressing
tens as crossing his scratches, thus X. His ideas, however,
enlarge, and he makes three scratches, thus [C with square sides],
to express 100. Generations of such vagabonds as founded Rome pass
away, and at length some one discovers that, by using but half the
figure for X, the number 5 may be conjectured to be meant. Another
calculator follows <span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id=
"page434"></a>{434}</span> up this discovery, and by employing [C
with square sides], half the figure used for 100, he expresses 50.
At length the rude man procured a better knife, with which he was
enabled to give a more graceful form to his [C with square sides],
by rounding it into C; then two such, turned different ways, with a
distinguishing cut between them, made CD, to express a thousand;
and as, by that time, the alphabet was introduced, they recognised
the similarity of the form at which they had thus arrived to the
first letter of <i>Mille</i>, and called it M, or 1000. The half of
this DC was adopted by a ready analogy for 500. With that discovery
the invention of the Romans stopped, though they had recourse to
various awkward expedients for making these forms express somewhat
higher numbers. On the other hand, the Hebrews seem to have been
provided with an alphabet as soon as they were to constitute a
nation; and they were taught to use the successive letters of that
alphabet to express the first ten numerals. In this way b and c
might denote 2 and 3 just as well as those figures; and numbers
might thus be expressed by single letters to the end of the
alphabet, but no further. They were taught, however, and the Greeks
learnt from them, to use the letters which follow the ninth as
indications of so many tens; and those which follow the eighteenth
as indicative of hundreds. This process was exceedingly superior to
the Roman; but at the end of the alphabet it required supplementary
signs. In this way bdecba might have expressed 245321 as concisely
as our figures; but if 320 were to be taken from this sum, the
removal of the equivalent letters cb would leave bdea, or
apparently no more than 2451. The invention of a cipher at once
beautifully simplified the notation, and facilitated its indefinite
extension. It was then no longer necessary to have one character
for units and another for as many tens. The substitution of 00 for
cb, so as to write bdeooa, kept the d in its place, and therefore
still indicating 40,000. It was thus that 27, 207, and 270 were
made distinguishable at once, without needing separate letters for
tens and hundreds; and new signs to express millions and their
multiples became unnecessary.</p>
<p>I have been induced to trespass on your columns with this
extended notice of the difficulty which was never solved by either
the Hebrews or Greeks, from understanding your correspondent
"T.S.D." p. 367, to say that "the mode of obviating it would
suggest itself at once." As to the original query,&mdash;whence
came the invention of the cipher, which was felt to be so valuable
as to be entitled to give its name to all the process of
arithmetic?&mdash;"T.S.D." has given the querist his best clue in
sending him to Mr. Strachey's Bija Ganita, and to Sir E.
Colebrooke's Algebra of the Hindus, from the Sanscrit of
Brahmegupta. Perhaps a few sentences may sufficiently point out
where the difficulty lies. In the beginning of the sixth century,
the celebrated Boethius described the present system as an
invention of the Pythagoreans, meaning, probably, to express some
indistinct notion of its coming from the east. The figures in MS.
copies of Boethius are the same as our own for 1, 8, and 9; the
same, but inverted, for 2 and 5; and are not without vestiges of
resemblance in the remaining figures. In the ninth century we come
to the Arabian Al Sephadi, and derive some information from him;
but his figures have attracted most notice, because though nearly
all of them are different from those found in Boethius, they are
the same as occur in Planudes, a Greek monk of the fourteenth
century, who says of his own units, "These nine characters are
Indian," and adds, "they have a tenth character called [Greek:
tziphra], which they express by an 0, and which denotes the absence
of any number." The date of Boethius is obviously too early for the
supposition of an Arabic origin; but it is doubted whether the
figures are of his time, as the copyists of a work in MS. were wont
to use the characters of their own age in letters, and might do so
in the case of figures also.</p>

<h3>ROMAN NUMERALS.</h3>
<p>There are several points connected with the subject of numerals
that are important in the history of practical arithmetic, to which
neither scientific men nor antiquaries have paid much attention.
Yet if the principal questions were brought in a definite form
before the contributors to the "NOTES AND QUERIES," I feel quite
sure that a not inconsiderable number of them will be able to
contribute each his portion to the solution of what may till now be
considered as almost a mystery. With your permission, I will
propose a few queries relating to the subject,</p>
<p>1. When did the abacus, or the "tabel" referred to in my former
letters, cease to be used as calculating instruments?</p>
<p>The last printed work in which the <i>abacal</i> practice was
given for the purposes of tuition that I have been able to
discover, is a 12mo. edition, by Andrew Mellis, of Dee's <i>Robert
Recorde</i>, 1682.</p>
<p>2. When did the method of <i>recording results</i> in Roman
numerals cease to be used in mercantile account-books? Do any
ledgers or other account-books, of ancient dates, exist in the
archives of the City Companies, or in the office of the City
Chamberlain? If there do, these would go far towards settling the
question.</p>
<p>3. When in the public offices of the Government? It is probable
that criteria will be found in many of them, which are inaccessible
to the public generally.</p>
<p>4. When in the household-books of royalty and nobility? This is
a class of MSS. to which I have paid next to no attention; and,
possibly, had the query been in my mind through life, many
fragments <span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id=
"page435"></a>{435}</span> tending towards the solution that have
passed me unnoticed would have saved me from the necessity of
troubling your correspondents. The latest that I remember to have
particularly noticed is that of Charles I. in the Fitzwilliam
Museum at Cambridge; but I shall not be surprised to find that the
system was continued down to George I., or later still.
Conservatism is displayed in its perfection in the tenacious
adherence of official underlings to established forms and venerable
routine.</p>

<h3>ERROR IN HALLAM'S HISTORY OF LITERATURE.</h3>
<p>If Mr. Hallam's accuracy <i>in parvis</i> could be fairly judged
by the following instance, and that given by your correspondent
"CANTAB." (No. 4, p. 51.), I fear much could not be said for it.
The following passage is from Mr. Hallam's account of Campanella
and his disciple Adami. My reference is to the first edition of Mr.
Hallam's work; but the passage stands unaltered in the second. I
believe these to be rare instances of inaccuracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tobias Adami, ... who dedicated to the philosophers of Germany
<i>his own Prodromus Philosophi&aelig; Instauratio</i>, prefixed to
his <i>edition</i> of Campanella's <i>Compendium de Rerum
Natur&aelig;</i>, published at Frankfort in 1617. Most of the other
writings of the master seem to have preceded <i>this edition</i>,
for Adami enumerates them in <i>his Prodromus</i>."&mdash;<i>Hist.
of Literature</i>, iii. 149.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title is not <i>Prodromus Philosophi&aelig; Instauratio</i>,
which is not sense; but <i>Prodromus Philosophi&aelig;
Instaurand&aelig;</i> (Forerunner of a philosophy to be
constructed). This <i>Prodromus</i> is a treatise of Campanella's,
not, as Mr. Hallam says, of Adami. Adami published the
<i>Prodromus</i> for Campanella, who was in prison; and he wrote a
preface, in which he gives a list of other writings of Campanella,
which he proposes to publish afterwards. What Mr. Hallam calls an
"edition," was the first publication.</p>
<p>Mere accident enabled me to detect these errors. I am not a
bibliographer and do not know a ten-thousandth part of what Mr.
Hallam knows. I extract this note from my common-place book, and
send it to you, hoping to elicit the opinions of some of your
learned correspondents on the general accuracy in biography and
bibliography of Mr. Hallam's <i>History of Literature</i>. Has Mr.
Bolton Corney, if I may venture to name him, examined the work? His
notes and opinion would be particularly valuable.</p>
<p>As a few inaccuracies such as this may occur in any work of
large scope proceeding from the most learned of men, and be
accidentally detected by an ignoramus, so a more extensive
impeachment of Mr. Hallam's accuracy would make a very trifling
deduction from his great claims to respect and well-established
fame. I believe I rightly understand the spirit in which you desire
your periodical to be the medium for emending valuable works, when
I thus guard myself against the appearance of disrespect to a great
ornament of literature.</p>

<h3>NOTES FROM CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>
<p>We have already shown pretty clearly, how high is the opinion we
entertain of the value of our able contributor Mr. Peter
Cunningham's amusing <i>Handbook for London</i>, by the insertion
of numerous Notes <i>upon</i> his first edition. We will now give
our readers an opportunity of judging how much the second edition,
which is just published, has been improved through the further
researches of that gentleman, by giving them a few Notes
<i>from</i> it, consisting entirely of new matter, and very curious
withal. When we add that the work is now enriched by a very copious
Index of Names, it will readily be seen how much the value and
utility of the book has been increased.</p>
<p><i>Hanover Square.</i>&mdash;"The statue of William Pitt, by Sir
Francis Chantrey, set up in the year 1831, is of bronze, and cost
7000<i>l.</i> I was present at its erection with Sir Francis
Chantrey and my father, who was Chantrey's assistant. The statue
was placed on its pedestal between seven and eight in the morning,
and while the workmen were away at their breakfasts, a rope was
thrown round the neck of the figure, and a vigorous attempt made by
several sturdy Reformers to pull it down. When word of what they
were about was brought to my father, he exclaimed, with a smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id=
"page436"></a>{436}</span> upon his face, 'The cramps are leaded,
and they may pull to doomsday.' The cramps are the iron bolts
fastening the statue to the pedestal. The attempt was soon
abandoned."</p>
<p><i>Hyde Park Corner.</i>&mdash;"There were cottages here in
1655; and the middle of the reign of George II. till the erection
of Apsely House, the small entrance gateway was flanked on its east
site by a poor tenement known as 'Allen's stall.' Allen, whose wife
kept a moveable apple-stall at the park entrance, was recognised by
George II. as an old soldier at the battle of Dettingen, and asked
(so pleased was the King at meeting the veteran) 'what he could do
for him.' Allen, after some hesitation, asked for a piece of ground
for a permanent apple-stall at Hyde Park Corner, and a grant was
made to him of a piece of ground which his children afterwards sold
to Apsley, Lord Bathurst. Mr. Crace has a careful drawing of the
Hyde Park Corner, showing Allen's stall and the Hercules'
Pillars."</p>
<p><i>Pall Mall.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Fox told Mr. Rogers, that Sydenham
was sitting at his window looking on the Mall, with his pipe in his
mouth and a silver tankard before him, when a fellow made a snatch
at the tankard, and ran off with it. Nor was he overtaken, said
Fox, before he got among the bushes in Bond Street, and there they
lost him."</p>
<p><i>Lansdowne House.</i>&mdash;"The iron bars at the two ends of
Lansdowne Passage (a near cut from Curzon Street to Hay Hill) were
put up late in the last century, in consequence of a mounted
highwayman, who had committed a robbery in Piccadilly, having
escaped from his pursuers through this narrow passage by riding his
horse up the steps. This anecdote was told by the late Thomas
Grenville to Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis. It occurred while George
Grenville was Minister, the robber passing his residence in Bolton
Street full gallop."</p>
<p><i>Newcastle House.</i>&mdash;"The old and expensive custom of
'vails-giving,' received its death-glow at Newcastle House. Sir
Timothy Waldo, on his way from the Duke's dinner table to his
carriage, put a crown into the hand of the cook, who returned it,
saying: 'Sir, I do not take silver.' 'Don't you, indeed?' said Sir
Timothy, putting it in his pocket; 'then I do not give gold.'
Hanway's 'Eight Letters to the Duke of &mdash;&mdash;,' had their
origin in Sir Timothy's complaint."</p>
<p><i>Red Lion Square.</i>&mdash;"The benevolent Jonas Hanway, the
traveller, lived and died (1786) in a house in Red Lion Square, the
principal rooms of which he decorated with paintings and
emblematical devices, 'in a style,' says his biographer, 'peculiar
to himself.' 'I found,' he used to say, when speaking of these
ornaments, 'that my countrymen and women were not <i>au fait</i> in
the art of conversation, and that instead of recurring to their
cards, when the discourse began to flag, the minutes between the
time of assembling and the placing the card-tables are spent in an
irksome suspense. To relieve this vacuum in social intercourse and
prevent cards from engrossing the whole of my visitors' minds, I
have presented them with objects the most attractive I could
imagine&mdash;and when that fails there are the cards.' Hanway was
the first man who ventured to walk the streets of London with an
umbrella over his head. After carrying one near thirty years, he
saw them come into general use."</p>
<p><i>Downing Street.</i>&mdash;"Baron Bothmar's house was part of
the forfeited property of Lee, Lord Lichfield, who retired with
James II., to whom he was Master of the Horse. At the beginning of
the present century there was no other official residence in the
street than the house which belonged, by right of office, to the
First Lord of the Treasury, but by degrees one house was bought
after another: first the Foreign Office, increased afterwards by
three other houses; then the Colonial Office; then the house in the
north corner, which was the Judge Advocate's, since added to the
Colonial Office; then a house for the Chancellor of the Exchequer;
and lastly, a whole row of lodging-houses, chiefly for Scotch and
Irish members."</p>
<p><i>Whitehall.</i>&mdash;"King Charles I. was executed on a
scaffold erected in front of the Banqueting House, towards the
park. The warrant directs that he should be executed 'in the open
street before Whitehall.' Lord Leicester tells us in his Journal,
that he was 'beheaded at Whitehall Gate.' Dugdale, in his
<i>Diary</i>, that he was 'beheaded at the gate of Whitehall;' and
a single sheet of the time reserved in the British Museum, that
'the King was beheaded at Whitehall Gate.' There cannot, therefore,
be a doubt that the scaffold was erected in front of the building
facing the present Horse Guards. We now come to the next point
which has excited some discussion. It appears from Herbert's minute
account of the King's last moments, that 'the King was led all
along the galleries and Banqueting House, and there was a passage
<i>broken through the wall</i>, by which the king passed unto the
scaffold.' This seems particular enough, and leads, it is said, to
a conclusion that the scaffold was erected on the north side. Where
the passage was broken through, one thing is certain, the scaffold
was erected on the west side, or, in other words, 'in the open
street,' now called Whitehall; and that the King, as Ludlow relates
in his Memoirs, 'was conducted to the scaffold out of the window of
the Banqueting House.' Ludlow, who tells us this, was one of the
regicides, and what he states, simply and straightforwardly, is
confirmed by any engraving of the execution, published at Amsterdam
in the same year, and by the following memorandum of Vertue's on
the copy of Terasson's large engraving of the Banqueting House,
preserved in the library of the Society of Antiquaries:&mdash;'It
is, according to the truest reports, said that out of this window
King Charles went upon the scaffold to be beheaded, the
window-frame being taken out purposely to make the passage on to
the scaffold, which is equal to the landing-place of the hall
within side.' The window marked by Vertue belonged to a small
building abutting from the north side of the present Banqueting
House. From this window, then the King stept upon the
scaffold."</p>

<h3>ANECDOTE OF CHARLES I.</h3>
<p>I have great pleasure in forwarding to you an anecdote of the
captivity of Charles I., which I think will be considered
interesting to your readers. Of its authenticity there can be no
doubt. I extract it from a small paper book, purchased some fifty
years since, at Newport, in the Isle of Wight, which contains the
history of a family named Douglas, for some years resident in that
town, written by the last representative, Eliza Douglas, at the
sale of whose effects it came into my grandfather's hands. There
are many curious particulars in it besides the anecdote I have sent
you; especially an account of the writer's great-great-grandfather
(the husband of the heroine of this tale), who "traded abroad, and
was took into Turkey as a slave," and there gained the affections
of his master's daughter, after the most approved old-ballad
fashion; though, alas! it was not to her love that he owed his
liberty, but (dreadful bathos!) to his skill in "cooking fowls,
&amp;c. &amp;c. in the English taste;" which, on a certain
occasion, when some English merchants came to dine with his master,
"so pleased the company, that they offered to redeem him, which was
accepted; and when freed he came home to England, and lived in
London to an advanced age; so old that they fed him with a
tea-spoon."</p>
<p>After his death his wife married again; and it was during this
second marriage that the interview with King Charles took
place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My mother's great-grandmother, when a-breeding with her
daughter, Mary Craige, which was at y'e time of <i>King Charles</i>
being a <i>prisoner</i> in <i>Carisbrook Castle</i>, she longed to
kiss the King's <i>hand</i>; and when he was brought to Newport to
be carried off, she being acquainted with the gentleman's
housekeeper, where the King was coming to stay, till orders for him
to leave the island, she went to the housekeeper, told her what she
wanted, and they contrived for her to come the morning he was to go
away. So up she got, and dressed herself, and set off to call her
midwife, and going along, the first and second guard stopped her
and asked her where she was going; she told them 'to call her
midwife,' which she did. They went to this lady, and she went and
acquainted his Majesty with the affair; he desired she may come up
to him, and she said, when she came into the room, his Majesty
seemed to appear as if he had been at <i>prayers</i>. He rose up
and came to her, who fell on her knees before him; he took her up
by the arm himself, and put his <i>cheek</i> to her, and she said
she gave him a good hearty smack on his cheek. His Majesty then
said, 'Pray God bless you, and that you go withal.' She then went
down stairs to wait and see the King take coach; she got so close
that she saw a gentleman in it; and when the King stept into the
coach, he said, 'Pray, Sir, what is your name?' he replied, 'I am
Col. Pride.' 'Not miscalled,' says the King. Then Pride says,
'Drive on, coachman.'"</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>THE MAUDELEYNE GRACE.</h3>
<p>The rector of Slimbridge, in the diocese of Gloucester, is bound
to pay ten pounds a year to Magdalen College, for "choir music on
the top of the College tower on May-day." (See Rudder's
<i>Gloucestershire</i>.) Some years ago a prospectus was issued,
announcing as in preparation, "The Maudeleyne Grace, including the
Hymnus Eucharisticus, with the music by Dr. Rogers, as sung every
year on May Morning, on the Tower of Magdalene College, Oxford, in
Latin and English. With an Historical Introduction by William Henry
Black." Can any of your readers inform me whether this interesting
work ever made its appearance? I am inclined to think it did not,
and have an indistinct recollection that the <i>original</i> MS. of
the "Grace" was lost through the carelessness of the lithographer
who was entrusted with it for the purpose of making a
fac-simile.</p>
<p>Whilst making some researches in the library of Christ Church,
Oxford, I accidentally met with what appears to me to be the
<i>first draft</i> of the "Grace" in question. It commences "<i>Te
Deum Patrem colimus</i>," and has the following note:&mdash;"This
Hymn is sung every day in Magdalen College Hall, Oxon, dinner and
supper throughout the year for the after grace, by the chaplains,
clarkes, and choristers there. Composed by Benjamin Rogers, Doctor
of Musique of the University of Oxon, 1685." It is entered in a
folio volume, with this note on the fly-leaf,&mdash;"Ben Rogers,
his book, Aug. 18. 1673, and presented me by Mr. John Playford,
Stationer in the Temple, London." The Latin Grace, <i>Te Deum
Patrem colimus</i>, is popularly supposed to be the <i>Hymnus
Eucharisticus</i> written by Dr. Nathaniel Ingelo, and sung at the
civic feast at Guildhall on the 5th July, 1660, while the king and
the other royal personages were at dinner; but this is a mistake,
for the words of Ingelo's hymn, very different from the Magdalen
hymn, still exist, and are to be found in Wood's collection in the
Ashmolean Museum. The music, too, of the <i>Te Deum</i> is in a
grand religious style, and not of a festal character.</p>

<hr />
<h3>"ESQUIRE" AND "GENTLEMAN."</h3>
<p>The custom of addressing almost every man above the rank of an
artizan or a huckster as "Esquire," seems now to be settled as a
matter of ordinary politeness and courtesy; whilst the degradation
of the gentleman into the "Gent," has caused this term, as the
title of a social class, to have fallen into total disuse.
Originally, they were terms that had their respective meanings as
much as Duke, Knight, Yeoman, or Hind; but now they simply mean
courtesy or contempt towards <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page438" id="page438"></a>{438}</span> the person to whom they are
applied,&mdash;with the exception, indeed, of certain combinations
of circumstances under which the word "Gentleman" is applied <i>as
a character</i>.</p>
<p>It would be an interesting occupation to trace the mutations of
meaning which these words have undergone, and the circumstances
which gave rise to the successive applications of them. The subject
has been often touched upon more or less slightly; but I know of no
work in which it is discussed fully, though, indeed, there may be
such. Of course, many of your readers are men whose pursuits have
lain in other directions than social customs, social language, and
social tastes; and, as one of them, I may be permitted to ask
either where a full discussion can be found, or that some of your
correspondents will furnish through your medium a clear and
tolerably full exposition of the question. I believe it would be of
general and public interest.</p>
<p>We naturally expect, that in <i>official correspondence</i>, the
public boards, through their proper officers, would be very precise
in assigning to every person his proper title, in the address of a
letter. Yet nothing can be more negligent and capricious than the
way in which this is done. I have held an appointment in the public
service, which is generally considered to carry with it the title
of "Esquire," (but really whether it do or not, I am unable to
tell), and have at different times had a good deal of official
correspondence, sometimes mere routine, and sometimes involving
topics of a critical character. From my own experience I am led to
think that no definite rule exists, and that the temper of the
moment will dictate the style of address. For instance, in
matter-of-course business, or in any correspondence that was
agreeable to official persons, I was addressed as "Esq.;" but if
the correspondence took a turn that was unpleasant, it was "Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;;" and on one occasion I received a note addressed
with my name denuded of all title whatever, even of the office I
filled. The note, I hardly need say, was "full of fire and fury;"
and yet, in less than half an hour, I received a second (the writer
having discovered his mistake), opening with "My dear Sir," and
superscribed with the "Esquire" at full length. This, I think,
proves the capriciousness of men in public stations in their
assignment of titles of this kind.</p>
<p>I certainly expected to find, however, in the "List of the
Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries," due attention paid to this
circumstance. The one just circulated was therefore referred to,
and it would seem to be as full of anomalies as a "Court Guide" or
a "Royal Blue Book." We have, indeed, the Knights and Baronets duly
titled, and the Peers, lay and spiritual, sufficiently
distinguished both by capitals and mode of insertion. All those who
have no other title (as D.D. or F.R.S.) recognised by the Society,
are courteously designated by the affix "Esq." In this, it will be
strange indeed if <i>all</i> be entitled to the appellation in its
legitimate sense; or, in other words, if the principle of courtesy
does not supersede, amongst the otherwise untitled mass of Fellows,
the principle of social rank. To this in itself, as the distinction
of "Gent" after a man's name has become derogatory, there cannot be
the least objection; for antiquarianism does not palliate rudeness
or offensive language.</p>
<p>At the same time, the adoption of this principle should surely
be uniform, and invidious distinctions should not be made. The
title "Esq.," should not be given to one man, and left out in
designating another whose social position is precisely the same.
For instance, we find in this list "&mdash;&mdash;, M.D.," and
"&mdash;&mdash;, Esq., M.D.," employed to designate two different
Doctors in Medicine. We find "&mdash;&mdash;, F.R.S." and
"&mdash;&mdash;, Esq., F.R.S." to designate two Fellows of the
Society of Antiquaries, who are also Fellows of the Royal. We see
one or two D.D.'s deprived of their titles of "Rev.," and, as if to
make amends (in point of quantity at least), we have one Fellow
with titles at each end of his name that seem incompatible with
each other, viz., "Rev. &mdash;&mdash;, Esq."</p>
<p>Anomalies like these can only be the result of sheer
carelessness, or of the ignorance of some clerk employed to make
out the list without adequate instructions given to him. It has, in
my hearing, been held up as a specimen of invidious distinction to
gratify some petty dislike; but this notion is simply absurd, and
deserves no notice. At the same time, it betokens a carelessness
that it is desirable to avoid.</p>
<p>As a mere question of <i>dignity</i>, it appears to me to savour
too much of Clapham-Common or Hampstead-Heath grandeur, to add much
to our respectability or worldly importance. It would, indeed, be
more "dignified" to drop, in the lists, all use of "Esq." under any
circumstances; or, if this be objected to, to at least treat
"M.A.," "D.D.," "F.R.S." as higher titles, in which the "Esq." may
properly be merged, and thus leave the appellation to designate the
absence of any higher literary or scientific title.</p>
<p>A good deal of this is irrelevant to the primary object of my
letter; but certainly not altogether irrelevant to the dignity of
the highest English representative body of arch&aelig;ology, the
Society of Antiquaries. I hope, at least, that this irrelevancy
will give neither pain nor offence to any one, for nothing could be
further from my wish or intention than such an effect. I have only
wished to illustrate the necessity for an accurate description of
what are really the original, subsequent, and present
significations of the words "Esquire" and "Gentleman," and to urge
that either some definite rule should be adopted as to their use in
official <span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id=
"page439"></a>{439}</span> and semi-official cases, or else that
they should be discontinued altogether.</p>

<h3>FIVE QUERIES.</h3>
<p>1. <i>Lines by Sir John Suckling.</i>&mdash;Is Sir John
Suckling, or Owen Feltham, the real author of the poem whose first
verse runs thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"When, dearest, I but think on thee,</p>
<p>Methinks all things that lovely be</p>
<p>Are present, and my soul delighted;</p>
<p>For beauties that from worth arise,</p>
<p>Are like the grace of deities,</p>
<p>Still present with us though unsighted."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I find it in the twelfth edition of Feltham's Works, 1709, p.
593., with the following title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This ensuing copy of the late Printer hath been pleased to
honour, by mistaking it among those of the most ingenious and too
early lost, Sir John Suckling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it also in the edition of Suckling's Works published at
Dublin, 1766. As I feel interested in all that relates to Suckling,
I shall be glad to have the authorship of this short poem rightly
assigned.</p>
<p>2. What is the origin and exact meaning of the phrase
"Sleeveless errand"? It is mentioned as late even as the last
century, by Swift, in his poem entitled <i>Reasons for not building
at Drapier's Hill</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Who send my mind as I believe, less</p>
<p>Than others do on errands sleeveless."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>3. What is the origin and derivation of the word "Trianon," the
name of the two palaces, Le Grand and Le Petit, at Versailles? and
why was it applied to them?</p>
<p>4. What is the correct blazon of the arms of <i>Godin</i>; with
crest and motto? I have seen an imperfect drawing of the arms,
Party per fess, a goblet transpierced with a dagger.</p>
<p>5. Whose is the line,</p>

<h3>QUERIES PROPOSED, NO. I.</h3>
<p>The non-appearance of my name as a querist has been rather
fortuitous, and it shall now be made evident that I am neither so
rich in materials, nor so proud in spirit, as to decline such
assistance as may be derived from the information and courtesy of
other contributors to the "Notes and Queries."</p>
<p>1. Did the following critical remarks on Shakspere, by Edward
Phillips, appear <i>verbatim</i> in the <i>Thesaurus</i> of J.
Buchlerus, 1669?</p>
<p>The Bodleian library has the London edition of 1636; and the
British Museum that of 1652. Wood cites an edition of 1669. I
transcribe from that of 1679.</p>

<p>2. What are the contents of a work entitled, [Old German script:
Schaubune Englischer und Fran&szlig;ofischer Com&aelig;dianten],
printed before 1671?</p>
<p>This work is recorded, but without a date, in the <i>Historia
literaria</i> of Simon Paulli, which was printed at Strasbourg in
1671. A statement of its contents would be very acceptable to
myself, and to other admirers of our early dramatic literature.</p>
<p>3. Who is the fortunate possessor of the <i>Lives and characters
of the English dramatick poets</i> with the marginal marks of
Garrick?</p>
<p>The copy in question was sold with the unreserved books of
Garrick in 1823, No. 1269. It contained this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the plays marked thus * in this catalogue, I bought of
Dodsley. Those marked thus O, I have added to the collection since.

common origin of the two? Camden, in his <i>Remains</i>,

<p><i>Howard, Earl of Surrey.</i>&mdash;Dr. Percy is said, in
Watt's <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i>, to have prepared an edition
of the poems of the Earl of Surrey, the whole impression of which
was consumed in the fire which took place in Mr. Nicholl's premises
in 1808. Can any of your readers say whether Dr. Percy had a copy

<p><i>Bawn.&mdash;Mutual.</i>&mdash;In vol. iii. p. 506. of
Hallam's <i>Constitutional History of England</i>, there occurs the
following passage in reference to the colonisation of Ulster in
1612, after Tyrone's rebellion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those who received 2000 acres were bound within four years to
build a castle and bawn, or strong court-yard; the second class
within two years to build a stone or brick house, with a bawn; the
third class a bawn only."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was the bawn, which was equally indispensable to the
grantee of 2000, 1500, or 1000 acres? Richardson variously
describes the term as almost any kind of dwelling, or "an enclosure
of walls to keep cattle from being stolen at night;" in fact, a
court-yard. This, however, conveys a very unsatisfactory idea,
unless I am justified in supposing that a court-yard was insisted
upon, even when a house could not be built, as insuring a future
residential settlement, and thereby warding off the evils of
absenteeism.</p>
<p>At page 514. of the same volume, I read,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wentworth had so balanced the protestant and recusant parties,
employed so skilfully the resources of fair promises and
intimidation, that he procured six subsidies to be granted before a
prorogation, without any <i>mutual</i> concession from the
crown."</p>

<h3>EARLY STATISTICS.&mdash;CHART, KENT.</h3>
<h4>(No. 21. p. 329.)</h4>
<p>The Registrar-General, in his Eighth Report, enters at length
into the causes which have brought about the variations in the
number of marriages, and consequently, as I need scarcely say, of
births. In comparing the marriage returns since 1754, which are
given in the report, with the history of events since that period,
he certainly makes it clear, to use his own words, that "The
marriage returns in England point out periods of prosperity little
less distinctly than the funds measure the hopes and fears of the
money-market." (p. 26. 8vo. edit.)</p>
<p>And that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The great fluctuations in the marriages of England are the
results of peace after war, abundance after dearth, high wages
after want of employment, speculation after languid enterprise,
confidence after distrust, national triumphs after national
disasters." (p. 27.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the civil wars, the diminishing influences indicated in
the reverse of this statement were at work with an intensity
unequalled in any other period of our modern history, so that there
can be no doubt that our then "unhappy divisions" did most
materially retard the numerical increase of the population, as well
as the progress of science and the useful arts. Such is the
inevitable consequence of war: of civil war in a tenfold degree.
And our parish register books, all of which I doubt not show
similar facts, place this in the most unfavourable light; for,
through the spread of nonconformity, the unsettled state of the
times, and the substitution during the protectorate of the
registration of births which might or might not be communicated to
the elected parish register, for that of baptisms which the parish
priest would both celebrate and register, the names of very many of
those born into the world would be altogether omitted from these
records. It may be interesting to show the effects of some of these
causes by the subjoined extracts from the registers themselves,
which I transcribe from the <i>Chronicon Mirabile</i> of the late
Sir Cuthbert Sharpe.&mdash;(Vide pp. 17. 18. 22. 23. 70. 121. and

</blockquote>
<p>From the Table, pp. 36, 37, it appears, that whilst the
population (estimated) in the thirty years 1600-1630 increased
upwards of 16 percent., in the forty years 1630-1670 it increased a
mere trifle over 3 per cent. only. In no fewer than twenty English
counties, the population, estimated as before, was absolutely less
in 1670 than in 1630; and in Kent, the county in which Chart is
situate, the decrease is striking: population of Kent in 1630,
189,212; in 1670, 167,398; in 1700, 157,833; in 1750, 181,267; and
in 1801, the enumerated population was 307,624.</p>

<h3>PARISH REGISTER STATISTICS.&mdash;CHART, KENT.</h3>
<p>Your correspondent "E.R.J.H." (No. 21. p. 330.) inquires whether
any general statistical returns, compiled from our early parish
registers, have been published. It must be a matter of regret to
all who are acquainted with the value of these national
records&mdash;which for extent and antiquity are unequalled in any
other country&mdash;that this question cannot be answered
affirmatively. By the exertions of the late Mr. Rickman, their
importance, in a statistical point of view, has been shown, but
only to a very limited extent. In 1801, being entrusted with the
duty of collecting and arranging the returns of the first actual
enumeration of the population, he obtained from the clergyman of
each parish a statement of the number of baptisms and burials
recorded in the register book in every tenth year from 1700, and of
marriages in every consecutive year from 1754, when the Marriage
Act of George II. took effect. The results were published with the
census returns of 1801; but, instead of each parish being
separately shown, only the totals of the hundreds and similar
county divisions, and of a few principal towns, were given. In
subsequent "Parish Register Abstracts" down to that of 1841, the
same meagre information has been afforded by an adherence to this
generalising system.</p>
<p>In 1836, with a view of forming an estimate of the probable
population for England and Wales at certain periods anterior to
1801, Mr. Rickman, acting upon the result of inquiries previously
made respecting the condition and earliest date of the register
books in every parish, applied to the clergy for returns of the
number of baptisms, burials, and marriages registered in three
years at six irregular periods, viz. A.D. 1570, 1600, 1630, 1670,
1700, and 1750. The clergy, with their accustomed readiness to aid
in any useful investigation, responded very generally to the
application, and Mr. Rickman obtained nearly 3000 returns of the
earliest date required (1570), and nearly 4000 (from not much less
than half the parishes of England) as far back as 1600; those for
the more recent periods being tolerably complete from all the
counties. The interesting details thus collected have not been
published; nor am I able to say where the original returns, if
still extant, are deposited. In pursuance of this design, however,
Mr. Rickman proceeded with these materials to calculate the
probable population of the several counties on the supposition that
the registered baptisms, &amp;c., in 1570, 1600, and at the other
assigned periods, bore the same proportion to the actual population
as in 1801. The numerical results are embodied in a table which
appears in the <i>Census Enumeration Abstract</i> for 1841
(Preface, pp. 36, 37.), and it is stated that there is reason for
supposing the estimate arrived at to be an approximation to the
truth.</p>
<p>During the Civil Wars and the Protectorate, few parochial
registers were kept with any degree of accuracy; indeed, in many
parishes they are altogether defective at that period, owing to the
temporary expulsion of the clergy from their benefices. It is not
improbable, therefore, that the remarkable decrease of baptismal
entries in the register book of Chart next Sutton Valence may have
arisen partly from imperfect registration, as well as from the
other causes suggested. But the trifling increase observable after
the Restoration undoubtedly points to the conclusion arrived at by
your corespondent&mdash;that a great diminution had taken place in
the population of the parish: and Mr. Rickman's estimate above
referred to gives a result for the entire county, which, if it does
not fully establish the supposed decrease, shows at least that the
registers of other Kentish parishes were affected in a similar
manner. The following is the estimated population of Kent, deduced
from the baptisms, burials, and marriages, by Mr.
Rickman:&mdash;</p>

<p>The population enumerated in 1801 was 307,624, which had
increased to 548,337 in 1841.</p>
<p>Applying the average of England to the parish <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>{443}</span> of Chart,
the 120 baptisms in the years 1640-1659, if representing the actual
births, would indicate a population of about 200 during that
period; while the 246 entries in the previous twenty years would
give upwards of 400 inhabitants. According to the several censuses,
Chart contained 381 persons in 1801, and 424, 500, 610, 604,
respectively, at the subsequent decades.</p>
<p>While on the subject of parish registers, I may add, that a
scheme has been propounded by the Rev. E. Wyatt Edgell, in a paper
read before the Statistical Society, for transcribing and printing
in a convenient form the whole of the extant parish register books
of England and Wales, thus concentrating those valuable records,
and preserving, before it is too late, their contents from the
effects of time and accidental injuries. The want of funds to
defray the cost of copying and printing is the one great difficulty
of the plan.</p>

<h3>EARLY STATISTICS.&mdash;PARISH REGISTERS.</h3>
<p>In reference to the observations of your correspondent
"E.R.J.H.," he will find, upon closer examination, that no
comparison approaching to accuracy can be made between the
population of any place at different periods of the seventeenth
century, founded upon the entries in parish registers of baptisms,
births, or marriages. In 1653 the ecclesiastical registers ceased
to contain much of the information they had before given. In that
year was passed, "An Act how Marriages shall be solemnised and
registered, and also for a Register of Births and Burials;" which
first introduced registers of births and not of baptisms. The Act
treated marriage as a civil contract, to be solemnised before a
justice of the peace; and it directed that, for the entry of all
marriages, and "of all births of children, and burial of all sorts
of people, within every parish," the rated inhabitants should
choose "an honest and able person to be called 'The Parish
Register,'" sworn before and approved by a neighbouring magistrate.
Until after the Restoration, this Act was found practicable; and in
many parishes these books (distinct from the clergyman's register
of baptisms, &amp;c., celebrated in the church) continue to be
fairly preserved. In such parishes, and in no others, a correct
comparative estimate of the population may be formed.</p>
<p>The value of the parochial registers for statistical and
historical purposes cannot be overrated; and yet their great loss
in very recent times is beyond all doubt. It was given in evidence
before the committee on registration, that out of seventy or eighty
parishes for which Bridges made collections a century since,
thirteen of the old registers have been lost, and three
accidentally burnt. On a comparison of the dates of the Sussex
registers, seen by Sir W. Burrell between 1770 and 1780, and of
those returned as the earliest in the population returns of 1831,
the old registers, in no less than twenty-nine parishes, had in the
interval disappeared; whilst, during the same half-century,
nineteen old registers had found their way back to the proper
repository. On searching the MSS. in Skelton Castle, in Cleveland,
a few years since, the first register of that parish was
discovered, and has been restored.</p>
<p>These changes show how great the danger is to which the old
registers are exposed; and in many instances it saves time and
trouble to search the Bishop's transcripts before searching the
original registers.</p>

<h3>BYRON'S LARA.</h3>
<p>I cannot agree with your able corespondent "C.B." (No. 20. p.
324., and No. 17. p. 262.), that Ezzelin in "Lara" is Seyd of the
"Corsair." My interpretation of both tales is as
follows:&mdash;Lara and Ezzelin both lived in youth where they
afterwards met, viz. in a midland county of England&mdash;time
about the fourteenth century. Ezzelin was a kinsman, or, more
probably, a lover of Medora, whom Lara induced to fly with him, and
who shared his corsair life. When Lara had returned home, the
midnight scene in the gallery arose from some Frankenstein creation
of his own bad conscience; a "horrible shadow," an "unreal
mockery." Kaled was Gulnare disguised as a page; and when Lara met
Ezzelin at Otho's house, Ezzelin's indignation arose from his
recollection of Medora's abduction. Otho favours Ezzelin in this
quarrel; and, when Kaled looks down upon the "sudden strife," and
becomes deeply moved, her agitation was from seeing in Ezzelin the
champion of Medora, her own rival in the affections of Lara.
Ezzelin is murdered, probably by the contrivance of Kaled, who had
before shown that she could lend a hand in such an affair. After
this, Lara collects a band, like what David gathered to himself in
the cave of Adullam, and what follows suits the medi&aelig;val
period of English history.</p>
<p>I will briefly quote in support of this view. Otho shows that
Lara and Ezzelin had both sprung from one spot, when he says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,</p>
<p>Though like Count Lara now return'd alone</p>
<p>From other lands, almost a stranger grown."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 9th section of canto 1. is a description of Byron himself at
Newstead (the two poems are merely vehicles of their authors' own
feelings), with the celebrated skull, since made into a drinking
cup, beside him. The succeeding section is a picture <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>{444}</span> of "our
own dear lake." That Medora was a gentlewoman, and not from the
slave-market, is shown by Conrad's appreciation of her in the 12th
section of the first canto of the "Corsair;" and why not formerly
beloved by Ezzelin, and thus alluded to by him in the quarrel
scene?</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!</p>
<p>At least thy memory was not given in vain,</p>
<p>Oh! never canst thou cancel half <i>her</i> debt,</p>
<p>Eternity forbids thee to forget."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The accents, muttered in a foreign tongue by Lara, on recovering
from his swoon in the gallery,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"And meant to meet an ear</p>
<p>That hears him not&mdash;alas! that cannot hear"&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>were addressed, I think, to Medora; and I am only the more
disposed to this opinion by their effect on Kaled. (See canto 1.
sec. 14.)</p>
<p>I quite agree with "EMDEE" in esteeming "Lara" a magnificent
poem.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Dr. Whichcot and Lord Shaftesbury.</i>&mdash;Your
correspondent "C." (No. 24. p. 382.) will find in the <i>Alumni
Etonenses</i>, by Harwood, printed at Birmingham by Pearson, and by
Caddell, jun., and Davies, Strand, 1797, at p. 46. in the account
of Whichcot, under the head of "Provosts of King's College," the
following passage:&mdash;"A volume of his sermons was published in
1628, from copies taken in short-hand as they were delivered from
the pulpit, with a preface by Lord Shaftesbury." In a MS. account
of the provosts it is stated, "the first volume of his discourses,
published by Lord Shaftesbury, 1698;" and that one of his brothers
was alive in 1749, at Finchley, aged 96.</p>
<p>A letter from Lord Lauderdale to Dr. Whichcot is in MS. Harl.
7045. p. 473. I take the figures from a printed, but not published,
account of some of the proceedings relating to Dr. Whichcot's
deprivation of his provostship at the Restoration, in which Lord
Lauderdale says, "For I took an opportunity, in the presence of my
Lord Chamberlain, your Chancellor, to acquaint his Majesty with
those excellent endowments with which God hath blesst you, and
which render you so worthie of the place you enjoy, (which the King
heard very graciously); afterwards he spoke with my Lord
Chamberlain about your concerns, and he and I are both of opinion
there is no fear as to your concerns." Was Shaftesbury ever
Chancellor of Cambridge? or who was the Lord Chamberlain who at
that time was Chancellor of the university? I have no means of
referring to any University History as to these points.</p>

<p><i>Black Doll at Old Store Shops.</i>&mdash;I asked you some
time since the origin of the Black Doll at Old Store Shops; but you
did not insert my Query, which curiously enough has since been
alluded to by <i>Punch</i>, as a mystery only known to, or capable
of being interpreted by, the editor of "Notes and Queries."</p>
<p class="author">A.C.</p>
<p class="note">[We are obliged to our correspondent and also to
our witty contemporary for this testimony to our omniscience, and
show our sense of their kindness by giving them two explanations.
The first is, the story which has been told of its originating with
a person who kept a house for the sale of toys and rags in Norton
Falgate some century since, to whom an old woman brought a large
bundle of rags for sale, with a desire that it might remain
unopened until she could call again to see it weighed. Several
weeks having elapsed without her re-appearance, the ragman opened
the bundle, and finding in it a <i>black doll</i> neatly dressed,
with a pair of gold ear-rings, hung it over his door, for the
purpose of its being owned by the woman who had left it. The plan
succeeded, and the woman, who had by means of the black doll
recovered her bundle of rags, presented it to the dealer; and the
story becoming known, the black doll was adopted as the favourite
sign of this class of shopkeepers. Such is the romance of the black
doll; the reality, we believe, will be found in the fact, that
cast-off clothes having been formerly purchased by dealers in large
quantities, for the purpose of being resold to merchants, to be
exchanged by them in traffic with the uncivilised tribes, who, it
is known, will barter any thing for articles of finery,&mdash;a
black doll, gaily dressed out, was adopted as the sign of such
dealers in old apparel.]</p>
<p><i>Journal of Sir William Beeston.</i>&mdash;In reply to the
inquiry of "C." (No. 25. p. 400), I can state that a journal of Sir
William Beeston is now preserved in the British Museum (MS. Add.
12,424.), and was presented to the national collection in 1842, by
Charles Edward Long, Esq. It is a folio volume, entirely autograph,
and extends from Dec. 10, 1671, when Beeston was in command of the
Assistance frigate in the West Indies, to July 21, 1673; then from
July 6 to September 6, 1680, in a voyage from Port Royal to London;
and from December 19, 1692, to March 9, 1692-3, in returning from
Portsmouth to Jamaica; and, lastly, from April 25 to June 28, 1702,
in coming home from Jamaica to England. By a note written by Mr.
Long on the fly-leaf of the volume, it appears that Sir William
Beeston was baptized in Dec. 2, 1636, at Titchfield, co. Hants, and
was the second son of William Beeston, of Posbrooke, the same
parish, by Elizabeth, daughter of Arthur Bromfield. (See <i>Visit.
C. 19. Coll. Arm.</i>) His elder brother, Henry, was Master of
Winchester, and Warden of New College; and his daughter and heir
Jane married, first, Sir Thomas Modyford, Bart., and, secondly,
Charles Long, to whom she was a second wife. To this may be added,
that Sir William received the honour of knighthood at Kensington,
October 30, 1692, and was Governor of Jamaica from 1693 till 1700.
In the Add. MS. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id=
"page445"></a>{445}</span> 12,430. is contained a narrative, by Sir
William Beeston, of the descent by the French on Jamaica, in June,
1694; as also the copy of a Journal kept by Col. William Beeston
from his first coming to Jamaica, 1655-1680.</p>

<p><i>Shrew</i> (No. 24. p. 381.).&mdash;I know not whether it will
at all help the inquiry of "W.R.F." to remind him that the local
Dorsetshire name of the shrew-mouse is "<i>shocrop</i>" or
"<i>shrocrop</i>." The latter is the word given in Mr. Barnes's
excellent <i>Glossary</i>, but I have just applied for its name to
two labourers, and their pronunciation of it is clearly the
former.</p>
<p>I should be glad to hear any conjecture as to the final
syllable. The only <i>folk-lore</i> connected with it in this part

others, viz. "Cats will kill, but not eat it."</p>

<p><i>Dissenting Ministers</i> (No. 24. p. 383.).&mdash;The verses
representing the distinctive characteristics of many ministers, by
allegorical resemblance to <i>flowers</i>, were written by the lady
whose paternal name is given by your correspondent. She married the
Rev. Joseph Brooksbank. I think it quite improbable that those
verses were ever published. It seems that two of the three names
mentioned in your description of this "nosegay" are erroneous. The
first is indisputable, RICHARD WINTER, a man of distinguished
excellence, who died in 1799. "Hugh Washington" is certainly a
mistake for HUGH WORTHINGTON; but for "James Jouyce" I can offer no
conjecture.</p>
<p class="author">J.P.S.</p>
<p><i>Ballad of "The Wars in France"</i> (No. 20. p.
318.).&mdash;Your correspondent "NEMO" will find two versions of
the ballad commencing,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"As our king lay musing on his bed,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>in appendices 20 and 21 to Sir Harris Nicolas's <i>History of
the Battle of Agincourt</i>, 2nd edit. They are not, I believe, in
the first edition. I have a copy of the ballad myself, which I took
down a few years ago, together with the quaint air to which it is
sung, from the lips of an old miner in Derbyshire. My copy does not
differ very much from the first of those given by Sir H.
Nicolas.</p>
<p class="author">C.W.G.</p>
<p class="note">["J.W." (Norwich), and "A.R." (Kenilworth), have
each kindly sent us a copy of the ballad. "F.M." informs us that it
exists as a broadside, printed and sold in Aldermary Church-yard,
Bow Lane, London, under the title of "King Henry V., his Conquest
of France, in Revenge for the Affront offered him by the French
King, in sending him (instead of the tribute due) a ton of tennis
balls." And, lastly, the "Rev. J.R. WREFORD" has called our
attention to the fact that it is printed in the collection of
<i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of
England</i>, edited by Mr. Dixon for the Percy Society in 1846.</p>
<p class="note">Mr. Dixon's version was taken down from the singing
of an eccentric character, known as the "Skipton Minstrel," and who
used to sing it to the tune of "<i>The Bold Pedlar and Robin
Hood</i>."]</p>
<p><i>Monody on the Death of Sir John Moore</i> (No. 20. p.
320.).&mdash;This Query has brought us a number of communications
from "A.G.," "J.R.W.," "G.W.B.," "R.S.," and "The Rev. L. COOPER,"
who writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undoubted author is the late Rev. Charles Wolfe, a young
Irishman, curate of Donoughmore, diocese of Armagh, who died 1823,
in the 32nd year of his age. His <i>Life and Remains</i> were
edited by the Archdeacon of Clogher; and a <i>fifth</i> edition of
the vol., which is an 8vo., was published in 1832 by Hamilton,
Adams, and Co., Paternoster Row. At the 25th page of the Memoir
there is the narration of an interesting discussion between Lord
Byron, Shelley, and others, as to the most perfect ode that had
ever been produced. Shelley contended for Coleridge's on
Switzerland; others named Campbell's Hohenlinden and Lord Byron's
Invocation in Manfred. But Lord Byron left the dinner-table before
the cloth was removed, and returned with a magazine, from which he
read this monody, which just then appeared anonymously. After he
had read it, he repeated the third stanza, and pronounced it
perfect, and especially the lines:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id=
"page446"></a>{446}</span>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,</p>
<p class="i4">With his martial cloak around him.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"'I should have taken the whole,' said Shelley, 'for a rough
sketch of Campbell's.'</p>
<p>"'No,' replied Lord Byron, 'Campbell would have claimed it, had
it been his.'</p>
<p>"The Memoir contains the fullest details on the subject of the
authorship, Mr. Wolfe's claim to which was also fully established
by the Rev. Dr. Miller, late Fellow of Trinity, Dublin, and author
of <i>Lectures on the Philosophy of Modern History</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="note">[With regard to the French translation, professing
to be a monody on Lally Tollendal, and to be found in the Appendix
to his Memoirs, it was only a clever hoax from the ready pen of
Father Prout, and first appears in Bentley's <i>Miscellany</i>. No
greater proof of the inconvenience of faceti&aelig; of this
peculiar nature can be required than the circumstance, that the
<i>fiction</i>, after a time, gets mistaken for a fact: and, as we
learn in the present case, the translation has been quoted in a
French newspaper as if it was really what it pretends to be.]</p>

<h3>IRON RAILINGS ROUND ST. PAUL'S.</h3>
<p>As the removal of the iron railing which surrounds St. Paul's
Churchyard is now said to be in contemplation, P.C.S.S. imagines
that it may not be unacceptable to the readers of "NOTES AND
QUERIES," if he transcribes the following account of it from
<i>Hasted's Kent</i>, vol. ii. p. 382, which is to be found in his
description of the parish of Lamberhurst:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was called <i>Gloucester Furnace</i> in honour of the Duke
of Gloucester, Queen Anne's son, who, in the year 1698, visited it
from Tunbridge Wells. The <i>iron rails</i> round St. Paul's
Churchyard, in London, were cast at this furnace. They compose the
most magnificent balustrade, perhaps, in the universe, being of the
height of five feet six inches, in which there are, at intervals,
seven iron gates of beautiful workmanship, which, together with the
rails, weigh two hundred tons and eighty-one pounds; the whole of
which cost 6d. per pound, and with other charges, amounted to the
sum of 11,202<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>"</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.</h3>
<p>If there was any ground, and we are inclined to believe there
was, for the objection urged by the judicious few against that
interesting series of illustrations of English history, Lodge's
<i>Illustrious Portraits</i>, namely, that in engraving the
portraits selected, truth had often times been sacrificed to
effect; so that one had a better picture, though a less faithful
copy,&mdash;such an objection cannot be urged against a work to
which our attention has just been directed, Harding's <i>Historical
Portraits</i>. In this endeavour to bring before us the men of past
time, each "in his habit as he lived," the scrupulous accuracy with
which Mr. Harding copies an old portrait has been well seconded by
the engravers, so that this work is unrivalled for the fidelity
with which it exhibits, as by a Daguerrotype, copies in little of
some very curious portraits of old-world worthies. The collection
is limited in extent; but, as it contains plates of individuals of
whom no other engraving exists, will be a treasure to illustrators
of Clarendon, Granger, &amp;c. Among the most interesting subjects
are <i>Henry VIII.</i> and <i>Charles V.</i>, from the remarkable
picture formerly at Strawberry Hill; <i>Sir Robert Dudley</i>, son
of Elizabeth's favourite; <i>Lord Russel of Thornhaugh</i>, from
the picture at Woburn; <i>Speaker Lenthall</i>; and the remarkable
portrait of <i>Henry Carey Viscount Falkland</i>, dressed in white,
painted by Van Somer, which suggested to Horace Walpole his
<i>Castle of Otranto</i>.</p>
<p>Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell on Thursday next, a small but
superb collection of drawings by modern artists; and on the
following Monday will commence a six days' sale of the third
portion of the important stock of prints of Messrs. Smith;
comprising some of the works of the most eminent engravers of the
continental and English schools, including a matchless collection
of the works of the Master of Fontainebleau, engraver's proofs of
book plates, and a few fine drawings.</p>
<p>We have received the following Catalogues:&mdash;J. Peteram's

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
